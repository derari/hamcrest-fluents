Fluents for Hamcrest 
====================

This is a fluent API for Java Hamcrest.

You can look at [an example](https://github.com/derari/hamcrest-fluents/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/cthul/matchers/fluent/ConceptTest.java) or browse the [interface declarations](https://github.com/derari/hamcrest-fluents/tree/master/core/src/main/java/org/cthul/matchers/fluent).

If you want to try it yourself, you can download it [here (without hamcrest)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10830039/hamcrest-fluent/cthul-fluent-matchers-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT-wo-hamcrest.jar)
or [here (with hamcrest)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10830039/hamcrest-fluent/cthul-fluent-matchers-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar),
or get it with Maven from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
